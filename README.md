# ft_push_swap
Sorting algorithm which sorts integers to ascending order.
This Program will take in integers from the command line, either in as a string or as arguments.
There is particular moves that it has to follow: rotate, reverse rotate, push to stack_a and b, switch places of the top two integers.
I made this using singular linkedlist and my own version of turk algorithm called turk"ish" algorithm.
